   - Used Datapower as solution for Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Small core team including myself and 2 other senior devs.
   - Developer for microservices and service onboarding for the DEV environment, integrating services for various teams wishing to provide services for other development projects. These services were usually SOAP XML based, JSON/REST based, or other older mainframe services, all having a unique translation or integration, sometimes with minimal passthrough, and sometimes with XSLX based translation.

## Personal thoughts and endeavours

### Strengths and Weakness

 - Detail oriented - I take "the devil is in the details" to heart, but can lead me to be less focused on the larger picture
 - Perfectionist - I enjoy making clean software that I don't have to overwrite many times, but can cause me to fine tune things unnecessarily
 - Small teams - I enjoy closer, more interpersonal relationships and familiarity in development teams, learning about how teammates function and think.
 - Analytical - I'm an overthinker which can be useful in making more airtight software, but also cause me to be overwhelmed.
 - Focused - In personal and work projects both, I tend to be highly bothered unless I can solve an unsolved problem.
 - Learning - I immensely enjoy learning new languages or tech. In the past as an amateur dev, I tended to over-learn and distract, but in more recent times I've gotten very good at learning what I need to learn in order to stay focused on the bigger picture or project

### Where am I at right now?

Since my initial time with Mastercard, I had to resign temporarily for some personal and family issues. But I've gotten to the point where I am actually now craving a project to work on. I miss working with a team or partner, diving into complexities, and the satisfaction of making things work.

During my time away though, I have still been studious. I discovered blockchain technology, and have already developed some prototypes for large-scale De-Fi projects using the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, both of which I use personally as well. Besides learning the inner-workings of various blockchains, it allowed me to learn Solidity, which is an EVM language, and Rust, a lower-level language with a completely different paradigm and coding style than what I am used to (Java/Python). I'm vary passionate about Rust, and would love the opportunity to work on something more serious so I can master it.

I am also dreaming of working on Blockchain tech in a more corporate environment, so I can gain some hardcore experience.

During my time I also gained a lot of knowledge of Linux, which I would also love to dive much deeper into. I also learned some basic ReactJS with a Udemy course. And I even got to teach a few people some basic programming :)
